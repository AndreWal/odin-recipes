    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna starts with a good foundation: the sauce and the filling. Most people use a rich tomato-based meat sauce, made by browning minced beef (or a beef–pork mix) with onions and garlic, then simmering it with tomatoes, herbs like oregano and basil, and a bit of salt and pepper. While that bubbles away, you can prepare a simple béchamel (white sauce) by melting butter, stirring in flour, and slowly whisking in milk until it thickens, seasoning with salt, pepper, and maybe a pinch of nutmeg. Grate plenty of cheese—usually mozzarella for meltiness and Parmesan for flavor. You can also swap the meat for vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms if you want a veggie version.</p>
    <p>Assembling the lasagna is a bit like building a tasty brick wall. You start with a thin layer of sauce in the baking dish, then add a layer of lasagna sheets (pre-cooked or no-boil, depending on what you’re using). On top of that go spoonfuls of béchamel, some of the meat or vegetable sauce, and a generous sprinkle of cheese. Then you repeat: pasta, sauces, cheese—until you reach the top. Finish with lots of cheese so it gets a golden crust. Bake it until the pasta is tender and the top is bubbly and slightly browned. The hardest part is waiting: let it rest for 10–15 minutes before cutting, so the layers set and you get neat slices instead of a delicious but messy avalanche.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with noodles, béchamel sauce, meat sauce, and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making pizza at home is a fun and rewarding experience. Start with a good pizza dough recipe or use store-bought dough for convenience. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Add your favorite toppings—classic choices include mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, and olives. Don't forget to season with a sprinkle of oregano and a drizzle of olive oil. Bake the pizza in a preheated oven at a high temperature (around 475°F or 245°C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</p>
